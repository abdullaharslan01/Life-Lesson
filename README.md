The first application I made for iOS. In this application, I made a simple application using Firebase where users can log in and share pictures and comments. Of course, it can be done more comprehensively. My goal is to learn and test what I've learned. I tested it with my friends.

I will update this application again in the future as an application that will tell people's life experiences. In this way, people will be able to talk about their experiences.
